title: Development time HTTP Network logs Support in ballerina VSCode plugin
---

Network logs is a useful tool for identifying issues/debugging for an integration developer.

Each log line has a corresponding interaction arrow in the diagram and we use that to derive the icons for the loglines. And the icons will help you to distinguish inbound/ outbound and upstream/downstream messages easily.

Using network logs analyser in ballerina vscode plugin you can,

*   See a list of all HTTP requests/responses with HTTP method, path, activity id and whether itâ€™s inbound/outbound connection.
*   You can filter the logs using the filter bar ( ex. Filter requests belong to a particular activity ID )
*   See the complete message including payload and headers. If the request payload is JSON you will see a formatted message.
